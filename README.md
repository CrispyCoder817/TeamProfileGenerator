  ## Install
  You would npm install all the inquirer packages and node modules, but keep a git ignore so you dont spend a bunch of space on the files. Running node index.js with the files on your local machine is for best results. 
  ## Usage
  It generates a Team Profile Generaotr using the input you type in the CLI to generate a series of cards for the employees. In future development it would be ideal for contact cards instead of using a rolodex from 1985; regardless how precious contacts on paper are. The best bet with this would be implementing everyone's imperative info like that of an emergency contact card for the right situation; if they are CPR certified and the like. Any and all certs would be an ideal use of this application.

  ## Tests
  If you are having trouble with this step try looking for the end brackets because that seems to be my biggest mistake is not ending or having an exgtra one floating around. The number one reason this would not work is failing to install all the proper npm packages.
